  These instructions are for who wish to use the XCode or Android Studio simulators instead of a physical device with Expo.
  Keep in mind, emulators require a lot of RAM, so you may find that bundling and displaying code takes much longer than when using a physical device.
  The official Expo docs with some troubleshooting tips are available here:

   ## macOS
   ### XCode iOS Simulator

    1. Download the full version of Xcode from the App Store. This is a huge file at around 7GB, so it can take a LONG time to download and install. It might seem like it it is stuck and not installing, but it is probably not.
    2. Launch XCode and agree to its terms. It will start installing more tools and software
    3. Eventually, you will get a "Welcome to XCode" screen
    4. In the top menu bar, click "XCode", then "Preferences" and then "Locations".
    5. Make sure that the "Command Line Tools" are installed and selected.
    6. In the top menu bar, click XCode, then "Open Developer Tool" then click "Simulator"
    7. This will open an iPhone simulator on your machine. If everything is working well, it should load a generic screen with a few apps.
    8. Go to your terminal and in your React Native project directory, `run npm start`
    9. When the Metro Bundler opens up in your browser, click on the option in the left sidebar to “Run on iOS simulator”
    10.If you navigate back to your iPhone simulator you should see an “Open In Expo” button. Click Open.
    11.This will launch the Expo application in the simulated device and run your bundled code. Eventually, it should load the `HomeScreen` screen.
